# Options-Screener
A Python script that filters stock options and generates a pdf report
# Stock Options Screener and Report Generator

This project is a Python-based automation tool designed to analyze and filter stock options data from multiple CSV files and generate a comprehensive PDF report of actionable call and put options. It demonstrates skills in data manipulation, automation, and report generation using widely adopted Python libraries.

---

## Overview

The tool processes bulk options data—typically exported from trading platforms—and streamlines the task of identifying high-interest options by applying predefined filters. It then compiles the filtered results into a clean, readable PDF report.

This project was created as a demonstration of practical Python scripting for real-world financial data analysis.

## Features

- Reads and combines multiple CSV files (Calls and Puts)
- Applies filters based on key metrics (e.g., open interest, premium, strike price)
- Generates a structured PDF report summarizing selected options
- Modular design for easy updates or integration with larger systems

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- `pandas` – for data loading, filtering, and transformation  
- `glob` and `os` – for batch file handling  
- `fpdf` – for generating PDF reports
